					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Here's my setup. I have been using this setup since the start of 2021.</p>
					<p>I use it for programming, web browsing and for university.</p>
					<p>The keyboard looks like it came from the 1980s - and it does, but I love it.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<em>
						'Because keyboards are accessories to PC makers, they focus on
						minimizing the manufacturing costs. But thatâ€™s incorrect. When
						Americaâ€™s cowboys were in the middle of a trip and their horse died, they
						would leave the horse there. But even if they were in the middle of a
						desert, they would take their saddle with them. The horse was a consumable
						good, but the saddle was an interface that their bodies had gotten used to.
						In the same vein, PCs are consumable goods, while keyboards are important
						interfaces.' - Philosophy of Professor Eiiti Wada / PFU Limited.
